/*
The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of
elementary rules that specifies how you write programs in that
language

JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language
keywords, variables, function names, and other identifiers must always
be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

JavaScript supports two styles of comments. Any text between a //
and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by
JavaScript.

A literal is a data value that appears directly in a program. The
following are all literals

An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to
name constants, variables, properties, functions, and classes and to
provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript code. A JavaScript
identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign
($)

The following words are part of the JavaScript language. Many of
these (such as if, while, and for) are reserved keywords that must
not be used as the names of constants, variables, functions, or classes
(though they can all be used as the names of properties within an
object)

JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set, and
you can use any Unicode characters in strings and comments. For
portability and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters
and digits in identifiers. But this is a programming convention only,
and the language allows Unicode letters, digits, and ideographs (but not
emojis) in identifiers. This means that programmers can use
mathematical symbols and words from non-English languages as
constants and variables
