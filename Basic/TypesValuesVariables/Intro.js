The kinds of values that can be
represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as
types, and one of the most fundamental characteristics of a
programming language is the set of types it supports.

Variables have names, and they allow use of
those names in our programs to refer to values. The way that variables
work is another fundamental characteristic of any programming
language
